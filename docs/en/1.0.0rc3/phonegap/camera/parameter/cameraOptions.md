            Camera.DestinationType = {
                DATA_URL : 0,                // Return image as base64 encoded string

Android Quirks
--------------

- Ignores the `allowEdit` parameter.
- Camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY and Camera.PictureSourceType.SAVEDPHOTOALBUM both display the same photo album.
- Camera.EncodingType is not supported.

BlackBerry Quirks
-----------------

- Ignores the `quality` parameter.
- Ignores the `sourceType` parameter.
- Ignores the `allowEdit` parameter.
- Application must have key injection permissions to close native Camera application after photo is taken.
- Using Large image sizes may result in inability to encode image on later model devices with high resolution cameras (e.g. Torch 9800).

Palm Quirks
-----------

- Ignores the `quality` parameter.
- Ignores the `sourceType` parameter.
- Ignores the `allowEdit` parameter.

iPhone Quirks
--------------

- Set `quality` below 50 to avoid memory error on some devices.
- When `destinationType.FILE_URI` is used, photos are saved in the application's temporary directory.
- The contents of the application's temporary directory is deleted when the application ends. Developers may also delete the contents of this directory using the navigator.fileMgr APIs if storage space is a concern.
